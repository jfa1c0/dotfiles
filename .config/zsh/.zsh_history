This one has one major difference, it's the first one I've been too while having someone who is walking with me. This is unique and harder than going at it solo. Definity an interesting, monumental, and soon to be life changing situation.\
There seem to be many players in this game. While you'll alwyas have people around that are somewhat invovled, this feels difference. I care about most of these people in one way or another and the ones I don't, I truly hope to care at some point.\
It seems hard to pin down the start of the current mess, especially when the past messes (speaking for myself), have long ago been forgivn and filed away where I never planned on revisiting them. I still believe that the best way, but only when dealing with your people. What is to be done when the truth of who is and is not your people comes into serious question?\
In the interest to being throuough I think it is essential for me to define what it means to be my people. Firstly, if your were or are one then this should be familiar and well understood by you. All can attest that at some point in their knowing me I've had a very real and serious conversation about the importance of this bond, sometimes multiple conversations. I was assured that all were in agreement and fully believed and supported this code that we will hold ourselves too. Here is what I live by and expect from anyone I've called family:\
1. Honesty with each other in absolutly all things no matter the cost. Ive come to find that this seems to be the one that ended up getting everyone when you distill it down. I really don't want to get into having to explain and debate this and that. If you're honest with yourself you'd not that any rebuttal you just thought of shows that either you don't agree or you're hiding something. Period. Off course we all break this one at somepoint, but 2 things matter when we do: 1. If discovered or suspected to be discovered did we own it? and 2. If it hasn't made it out and we can't come clean, does it bother us. That's a tough question that is impossible to answer on the spot, so if you immediatly thought "Ok, nice, I'm good", that means you're lying to yourself and you should spend a great deal more time thinking and meditating on it.\
2. Loyalty no matter the cost. While I appreciate anyone who will go into battle with me, what's more revealing is the one's who will go for me when I can't. I've heard some soul crushing things these past several weeks that I knew with all of my being had to be lies. Turns out I was wrong. For the time being I still consider everyone my people and I just assume that they had too do and say those things and just can't fill me in yet. Which leads us to the next point.\
3. Belive what your people consistiently say. Everyone knows that I like to hear it all. I never want to be protected by my people from hearing something. I have to feel the pain, it is essential to go through all of that if you want to be prepared for the next move. If you've experienced my intuition, then you already know. It truly amazes me how people can see that and be completley blown away and in awe and yet weeks, months, years later they'll make excuses and rationalize.\
4. Love, the greatest of all. Most know my feelings on the word Love, especially Steph. I had assumed we all were mostly in agreement on the meaning, but it seems not. Also, it matters not what you're definition is right now if you know what mine is. That's not a mean thing to say. It's fairly simple to understand, if I have told you what I think Love is and you either openly agreed or continued to tell myself and others that you Love me, then that signifies that you agree with my definition and I can count on you to feel the same as me when it comes down to it. So here is what most have heard from me consistantly without change:\
1. There are no "levels" of Love. It's all in or all out. No "I love you like a brother" and stuff like that. In order for it to mean something then it has to be special and rare. It's a small list of people who hear me say that I love them and I truly question anyone who throws it around so freely.\
2. Permanant. Real Love never stops. It is impossible. If the Love disappears then what you have to freely and openly admit is that it was never there. If you can't do this, then get back to work and let's figure it out. I cannot understand why this is so hard for people. Most of everything in this list has cases where certain people, including myself, will struggle, that's fully understood, but this one? Absolutly not! This is the easiest, more uplifting and freeing thing here and it is crazy simple. To get it though, you have to quit trying to add words that I'm not saying and slowy step through it. We'll use Steph and I as an example, but this applies the same to any relationship. 1. We both claim to Love the other 2. Stuff happens, big huge scary stuff and everyday little stuff. 3. Still saying and agreeing that we Love eachother. 3. Rinse and repeat until 4. Steph says either to me or someone else "I don't love you / him anymore" or "I have love for him, but it's too much". Now, I have yet to ever feel like I don't love her so I'm not sure what she expects next, but her actions / words / and logic would say next would be the end, no more, finished. I don't thing anyone of us needs to see the numbers on how often that works, so like Ive always said, there is a next step, that if you are being honest with yourself, will be the best most freeing over the top great feeling: 5. Come to your person once things are calm, seek peace, and have compassion for them as a human. Look them in the eyes and say "I never loved you". That's it. Stop there. If you have to preface it or follow up with something, then you need to think on it a little more. It should flow compasionatly and freely from your lips, if that's hard or worse yet impossible, then it has to be a lie. There is no other explanaion and if you immedialty thought of one then you need to keep trying to understand, because any reply, rebutal, or special case when it comes to what I just said just proves my point: 1. It was all a lie and there never was Love or 2. You still Love the person. There can be no middle ground and to me thats what makes it so awesome. I sometimes get the feeling that some are worried about how I would react if Steph was able to truly say it and mean it and that worry she / they have comes from assuming and not from what I've said. It's simple for me, it has to be imposibble for just one side to have Loved and the other to be fooled / faking / confused / whatever. Has to be, 100% undebatable. If that was the case then both were never in Love and felt it for differnt reasons or something. Regardless of which it is, at the moment it is said and meant then its done. No hard feelings, all good. Truly if each is 100% honest and it really never was then an awesome friendsship, free of jealosy and anger, should emerge from the ashes almost instantly. Anything on either side that makes that friendship imposible or even "hard" or "complicated" should definatly be looked at to make sure that everyone was honest with themselves. Do you know how fucking awesome I would feel if all of this hurt was over and I ended up with Steph as my best friend? Holy shit, that would be the greatest thing next to having her (but at that point it would be the greatest thing regardless, because we would have already established that we never were in Love). I hope that I was clear and you at least have reached a point where you are trying to get it. If someone is confused, ask questions! But, that comes with a warning: You know your intention generally when speaking with someone. Don't ask condesending questions, don't ask leading questions. Be geniuine, you know when you are and so does the other person.\
I know it's a lot, but if anyone feels like it's too much then they're doomed. At the end of the day if you can't accept that definition of Love, then why would you go on? Steph is without a doubt the only person I've ever felt this way about, could there be another? I don't believe so, but maybe. I lean toward no, there cannot be, because if we're done then we never were, so the next one is another one, their just The One. I guess I can only speak for myself, but this is how it is and everyone that matters agreed at one point or another. So if we can all be rational then we have 2 choices, either we lied or we have work to do.\
I've heard over and over that it goes in circles and nothing ever gets accomplished. I'm tired of hearing that. Do we just say "Fuck it" or do we figure it out? If your answer is "Fuck it" then you need to go up to the previeious section and admit you never Loved. If that's not the case, then how do we fix it? Obvisoly I havent solved that problem. I have some ideas. This is where it falls apart and I'm willing to take most of the blame. I'm pretty loud and passionate when talking and that gets miscontrued as anger. I assure you and I just freely admitted I don't know how to solve the going in cirles part. I have ideas and when I say ideas, I mean things that are not rules or set in stone. Maybe some are right, maybe some are wrong. Importat thing is that we debate and be honest so we can move to a soulution. In my mind and I bet yours too if you truly think about it, the first thing to do is be honest. It's so easy to just agree and move on, and that is the right thing to do in a ton of situations, but absoulty not this. This has to be right for the relationship to work and often ignored and truly more importantly this has to be right for the relationship to end. Will it be quick? Very doubtful. Will it hurt? I would be shocked if it didnt. Will it be comfortable? I truly hope not, else what are we doing here. One thing has shown itself to be absoutly true though: It has to be done. I will onlt speak for my own relationship, but I'm sure it applies partly to others. I 100% do not think that Steph and I have ever done one thing to fix our problem. There is no point in looking to assign blame either, really dosent matter in the end. We obvisioly are both at fault, some of our blood family is at fault, some of our exes are at fault, some of our Family family are at fault, hell, some random ass people are at fault. The fault still applies even if their heart was pure. But none of that matters, problem is still there, who cares who did it, who is going to get started fixing it? Thats what is important.\
One more thing that is important and I've never hidden or denied. If you Love me, care for me, consider yourself my friend, or say any of those things then when I say Steph is the one then if you choose to question that the burden of proof is on you. I don't have to prove she is, obvisoly I think that I KNOW it. If you want to question any part of her and I then you have to come with facts and big ones, you also have to be willing to listen to what I have to say about it. That's where it gets twisted. People already have their mind closed off and made up. You do relaize that just weakens your argument, right? If you belive something you should be able to defend it and your belief should hold up to any and all tests. If it dosent then why are you willing to belive it? I think most of the times when we claim to beleive, feel, or know something untrue its one of two things, we think we are protecting ourselves or protecting some one else. In realaty we are hurting everyone. \
If you feel like "Screw this, not worth the effort", then that's actually ok. Just be honest about it, so everyone can quit fighting for Truth and Love. No shame in that, just be compaasionate and honest.\
Honest. That brings us full circle. I think that's really what all of the issues that arrive out of Love come from. Crazy thing is, I bet if we kept track, we'd find out that it's not other people we're lying too most of the time, it's ourselves and I truly strive to do that less and less. While I believe I have a person who's importance to me cannot even be put to words, at the end of the day, the only person I'm guranteed to have foreve is me, why would I tell myself lies? That's insanity. I'm sure we all have some work to do on that. I know I do and I know that I woudl love each of yall to help.\
People say this next piece is mean, unreasonable, stubborn, whatever. If so, then you need to look inside yourself for the answer to that. The following is backed up by everything from FBI negotiators to Professional Poker Players and anyone else on this planet who has mastered the art of reading people:\
If you snap back quickly with a response, reply, or rebuttal the it instantly tells the other (if they are paying attention) that either never heard them or are rufusing to care. yes, there are edge cases where a quick reply is the best move, but if you knew that then you would've known that's not what I'm talking about and If you really understood it, you'd know that generally the only time a quick replay is effective is when you're bluffing or persuading, neith of which I would hope anyone feels would be appropriate in this context. If so, go back up to that step where you admit it was all a lie, casue that where you find yourself.\
Here's the really tough one though, when you find yourself forming your counter or reply before you're done reading or listening, then that's 100% on you. You are the only one who can square that. If its something important like this, then you have to be willing to say that you do not care and whatever that brings about dosent matter. If that's the case, then I sure hope you're sure. I've been there and theres plenty I wish I would have slowed down to consider. but if you truly without a doubt know that's the real you rushing through it and you've given it all the cosideration posible, then all that's left is to say it, but you have to save it never was Love, becasue that;s the only way that shows you're Honesty. Maybe you can tell the whole world that without a second thought, but what if you can't tell the one that matters? Should be easy, why isn't it? The greatest things are the hardest, but always worth it. At the end of the day you are stuck permanatly living with yourself and a clear concience is the only way. Anything else will eat you alive. That's not something I came up with, that's part of ever Religion, NA, AA, Psychologist, Psychiatrist, Guru, Life Coach, and Honest peoples teaching.\
I hope everyone understands that I seek to blame or point out anything about any of you. I'm probably the most guilty one of all. If you think I'm talking about you and our offended, then you just proved my point. Take a look at yourself, casue I've found that in my life that's usually where the healing starts.\
If you are reading this and you think I've wrongged you and not made it right, wholeheartdly tried too, or you havent told me then you need to tell me. I'll never make up for the wrongs that I've done, but it is essential for myself and I be you too that I own them. If I was wrong, then I'll never stop making up for it. If I hurt your feelings or other relationships directly or indirectly then I'd love to talk about it, but be prepared, because if I did it, know I did it, and blatently did it, more than likely I'm prepared to defend my position, because I swear that's not something I take lioghtly. \
Honesty is mostly pain, trick is learning that in the whole arc of your life it's just like getting a shot when you were little. Hurts like hell for a blip and in the end it was worth it. Probably nothing anyone can say to sway you if you don't agree. The data shows that everyones previous ways and solutions did'nt work, so you'll need to explain that to yourself. Don't have the gall to tell me you want Peace and Happiness if you're not willing to feel the pain and do the work that in your very soul you know is required. Fake it the rest of your life if you want, but dont lie to me about it. I watched my dad be miserable on his jet, flying to his 2nd mansion in Colorado, surrounded by "friends", he wasn't willing to feel that pain and it killed him. I'll always hold my people accountable, so that never happens to them. I Love you all. Who is with me?\
